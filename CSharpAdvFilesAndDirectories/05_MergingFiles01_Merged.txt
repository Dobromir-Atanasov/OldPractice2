A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Two households, both alike in dignity,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
