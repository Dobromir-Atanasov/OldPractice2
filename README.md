# SoftUniPractice
Some solutions from my practice with SoftUni's courses.
Warning! There could (and probably will be) some incorect or unfinished solutions. Use them on your own risk!
Since I'm still studing, most of the solutions are not optimal or could make headache if you want to understand how they work.
